# Cybersecurity-Vulnerability-Management-Project-using-Nessus
This repository is dedicated to streamlining and enhancing vulnerability management process for Windows 10 Hosts using Nessus Essentials. In this independent project, I will undertake a comprehensive exploration of vulnerability management, focusing on individual efforts to secure a virtual environment. The goal is to strengthen my cybersecurity skills and knowledge through hands-on vulnerability assessment and remediation.

# Project Overview:

1. Environment Setup:
I will start by setting up a virtual environment using VMware Workstation Player, simulating a Windows 10 system.

2. Legacy Software Installation:
Within the virtual machine, I will install deprecated software, mimicking potential real-world vulnerabilities.

3. Vulnerability Scanning:
Employing cutting-edge vulnerability scanning tools, I will systematically assess the virtual machine for security flaws and vulnerabilities.

4. Risk Identification:
I will analyze the results of the vulnerability scans, pinpointing potential risks and security weaknesses.

5. Remediation:
The most critical part of the project will involve addressing these vulnerabilities. I will prioritize and remediate one or two vulnerabilities, reducing their risk to an acceptable level.

6. Self-Observation:
Throughout this process, I will keenly observe and document the changes and improvements in the virtual environment's security posture.

## Project Goals:

- Enhance my personal skills and understanding of vulnerability management.
- Independently identify and remediate vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
- Develop proficiency in risk mitigation techniques.
- Create a comprehensive project report that serves as a reference for future security assessments.

## Upon the project's completion, I expect to achieve the following:

- A heightened awareness of the significance of vulnerability management.
- Enhanced skills in assessing and remediating vulnerabilities.
- A detailed project report capturing the vulnerabilities, remediation process, and observed outcomes.

This solo project is an essential step toward advancing my expertise in cybersecurity and equipping me with the ability to secure systems against potential threats. By exploring vulnerability management and practically applying remediation techniques on my own, I aim to fortify my cybersecurity capabilities and contribute to a safer digital environment.
