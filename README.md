# Cybersecurity-Vulnerability-Management-Project-using-Nessus
This repository is dedicated to streamlining and enhancing vulnerability management process for Windows 10 Hosts using Nessus Essentials. In this independent project, I will undertake a comprehensive exploration of vulnerability management, focusing on individual efforts to secure a virtual environment. The goal is to strengthen my cybersecurity skills and knowledge through hands-on vulnerability assessment and remediation.

# Project Overview:

1. Environment Setup:
I will start by setting up a virtual environment using VMware Workstation Player, simulating a Windows 10 system.

2. Legacy Software Installation:
Within the virtual machine, I will install deprecated software, mimicking potential real-world vulnerabilities.

3. Vulnerability Scanning:
Employing cutting-edge vulnerability scanning tools, I will systematically assess the virtual machine for security flaws and vulnerabilities.

4. Risk Identification:
I will analyze the results of the vulnerability scans, pinpointing potential risks and security weaknesses.

5. Remediation:
The most critical part of the project will involve addressing these vulnerabilities. I will prioritize and remediate one or two vulnerabilities, reducing their risk to an acceptable level.

6. Self-Observation:
Throughout this process, I will keenly observe and document the changes and improvements in the virtual environment's security posture.

## Project Goals:

- Enhance my personal skills and understanding of vulnerability management.
- Independently identify and remediate vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
- Develop proficiency in risk mitigation techniques.
- Create a comprehensive project report that serves as a reference for future security assessments.

## Upon the project's completion, I expect to achieve the following:

- A heightened awareness of the significance of vulnerability management.
- Enhanced skills in assessing and remediating vulnerabilities.
- A detailed project report capturing the vulnerabilities, remediation process, and observed outcomes.

This solo project is an essential step toward advancing my expertise in cybersecurity and equipping me with the ability to secure systems against potential threats. By exploring vulnerability management and practically applying remediation techniques on my own, I aim to fortify my cybersecurity capabilities and contribute to a safer digital environment.

# Resources

I will provide the links to resources that will be required to follow along if you wish to do so: 
- [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)
- [Windows 10 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)
- [Nessus Essentials](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials)

I won't be covering the installation process for Nessus and VMware but you can follow the directions on your own it's fairly easy.

# Setup Virtual Machine

- Open you VMware Workstation (you can choose to use VirtualBox as well) and create a New Virtual Machine as shown below.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/mehakashik/Cybersecurity-Vulnerability-Management-Project-using-Nessus/blob/main/VMN%20Images/1.png">
</p>

- Select the Windows 10 ISO you downloaded before and click on next.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/mehakashik/Cybersecurity-Vulnerability-Management-Project-using-Nessus/blob/main/VMN%20Images/2.png">
</p>

- Choose "Customize Hardware".

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/mehakashik/Cybersecurity-Vulnerability-Management-Project-using-Nessus/blob/main/VMN%20Images/3.png">
</p>

- I am opting to give the VM 4 GB RAM, 4 processors and 50 GB disk size. If you do not know your PC specs or have a weaker system you can choose to leave the default selections.
- Under "Network Adapters" go to "Network Connection" and select "Bridged".

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/mehakashik/Cybersecurity-Vulnerability-Management-Project-using-Nessus/blob/main/VMN%20Images/4.png">
</p>

- Bridged networking places the virtual machine on the same network as your physical computer, facilitating easier communication between your Nessus implementation and the virtual machine.
- Now select "Configure Adapters" and uncheck VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter. (Note: I don't know if this is an option in all systems or if it is because I have VirtualBox installed as well but when I launched the VM and checked for an IP address it didn't have any and deselecting this fixed the issue for me.)

    <img src="https://github.com/mehakashik/Cybersecurity-Vulnerability-Management-Project-using-Nessus/blob/main/VMN%20Images/14.png">
</p>

- Click on "Finish" when done.
